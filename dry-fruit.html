<p>Prunes are dried plums, most commonly from the European variety Prunus domestica. Known for their rich flavor, chewy texture, and natural sweetness, prunes have been enjoyed for centuries as both a nutritious snack and a natural remedy. Their deep purple-black color and wrinkled appearance may not be glamorous, but their nutritional punch and versatility make them a pantry staple across the globe.</p>

<p>Prunes are a nutritional powerhouse, packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. They’re especially high in dietary fiber, which supports digestive health and can help prevent constipation. They also contain vitamin K, potassium, magnesium, and iron—nutrients essential for bone strength, heart health, and blood function. Prunes are also rich in polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that support overall wellness.</p>

<p>One of the most well-known benefits of prunes is their role in promoting digestive regularity. Their high soluble and insoluble fiber content, combined with natural sorbitol (a sugar alcohol with laxative effects), makes prunes a gentle and effective way to relieve constipation naturally. This has made prunes a go-to home remedy across generations, especially among older adults and children.

<p>Beyond being a healthy snack, prunes are surprisingly versatile in cooking and baking. They can be added to breakfast cereals, salads, yogurt, or trail mixes. In baking, prunes are often used to sweeten muffins, cakes, and energy bars. They can even be pureed to replace sugar or fat in recipes. In savory dishes, they add depth and richness to meat stews, sauces, and Middle Eastern dishes, pairing beautifully with ingredients like lamb, rice, and spices.

<p>Prunes should be stored in a cool, airtight container to preserve their moisture and freshness. Some prunes are treated with a light vegetable oil to prevent sticking. When buying, look for plump, moist prunes without added sugars or preservatives for the healthiest option. Their naturally sweet flavor and extensive health benefits make prunes a smart, satisfying addition to any diet.</p>
